# HealthApplication early development

Have you ever needed to arrange a doctor's appointment and had to search through hundreds 
of hospitals around the city, dozens of physicians, and various sections? Or have you been put in a 
position where you must bring all your medical records with you whenever you see a doctor? Isn't it 
better to have all that information in one place?

Nowadays, everyone carries their phone with them at all times, so why not utilize it as a health 
gadget as well?

The Health App was designed to store all important and sensitive health information, such as 
name, date of birth, blood type, height, weight, pre-existing conditions, past examinations, and 
medications, while also providing the user with valuable information such as nearby hospitals, 
different healthcare facilities suitable for different procedures, and a list of doctors.
The simple and straightforward design makes it ideal for all users, whether experienced or 
new to technology, and the Firebase database allows it to hold a significant quantity of data.
All you have to do is sign up with your email or phone number and create a secure password. 
After that, provide any other information you believe medical professionals should know about you. 
Scan the findings of your investigations, your prescriptions, and even your X-rays, CT scans, and 
MRIs.

This document describes the steps involved in creating and developing the Health App and is 
divided into two chapters: the first provides a brief theoretical introduction to the technologies used, 
while the second provides an outline of the application, explanations of the main classes, and a brief 
demonstration of how to use it.
